          Did you ever feel like a website you are using doesn't make any sense?
          Maybe the layout is strange, or a button is missing, or it's just
          really old and hard to navigate. Recently, I was planning a little
          trip for spring break, and I wondered on a relatively nice looking
          <a

          The location looked great and the price was affordable, so I was
          really excited to look into this option. However, when I started
          exploring the booking part of the page, I could not proceed. All of
          the "select dates" buttons were grayed out, and I believed the rooms
          are no longer available. Hovering over the button produced no effect,
          so did clicking. Little did I know that the intended way to use the
          page is to scroll all the way above the room "cards" and fill in the
          filters manually!

              The interface does a very poor job of showing an unfinished
              booking process. While browsing the rooms, the user might see the
              "select dates" button, and assume that it will take them to
              choosing dates for this room. However, the button does nothing,
              which is a very poor design for learnability and efficiency
            </li>
            <li>
              It is not immediately clear that control texts are also buttons,
              as they are not underlined, which hurts learnability a lot
            </li>
            <li>
              The price slider is hidden and doesn't show the default range,
              again hurting learnability
            </li>
            <li>
              It was easy to memorize this interface, but unfortunately due to
              negative features: poorly scaled pictures on the front page and
              the command buttons around the booking
            </li>
            <li>
              Occasionally, the booking page times out with "Too many requests"
              error. While this is more of a software topic, it looks like the
              information is re-fetched from their database every time something
              gets updated, which signals poor use of caching
            </li>

        <p style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
          While I was pretty upset with this navigation system, I decided to
          channel my energy into a solution. My main focus was to redesign the
          page such that it keeps most of its elements, but a) fixes the problem
          of the button, and b) remains responsive and maintains valid style on
          any screen size or zoom level. 
        </p>
        <p> The first step was to create a style sheet in Figma</p>

            style="width: 100%; height: 650px; object-fit: contain"
          />
        </div>
        <p style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
          With this design palete in mind, I used figma to create mockups of the 
          three main device types that this website is used for.

      <h2 style="color:#2c5e6d">A conclusion</h3>
      <p style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
        The end result can be found <a href="https://bkaravan.github.io/cs1300-redesign/">here!</a> Of course, this mock-up is just the first
        part of an actual redesign, since the new button is just mockup that still 
        doesn't implement date selection. However, it remains an active hoverable 
        and clickable button at every step of the user interaction, and it removes 
        a lot of learnability and memorability complexity that was introduced by the initial design. 
        Lastly, this page is made accessible by providing alt text, not having empty 
        or unused elements, and making sure it properly scales on any device size 
        or zoom level.
